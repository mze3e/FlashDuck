**High-performance data management powered by DuckDB**

FlashDuck is a lightweight data management solution built on DuckDB. It keeps a local DuckDB cache synchronized with source files so you can query fresh data instantly‚Äîperfect for real-time applications and analytics.

Real-time sync: Folder-based or application-level changes are captured and reflected in the DuckDB cache.

Single-file Parquet consolidation: Updates are automatically consolidated into a clean Parquet file for durability and downstream use.

Embedded queries: DuckDB runs SQL directly against the cached tables for sub-second analytics without batch ETL.

Lightweight & embeddable: Runs anywhere‚Äîno external services or clusters required.

Flexible integration: Use it as a cache, an analytics engine, or both. Ingest files, query with standard SQL, export with Parquet.

FlashDuck is designed for developers and analysts who want the simplicity of DuckDB with automatic synchronization‚Äîwithout the overhead of a full data warehouse or lakehouse.
